# Credit Scoring and Segmentation

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust credit scoring model that can accurately predict the creditworthiness of individuals by calculating a credit score by FICO formula. Additionally, it segments customers based on their credit scores to enable tailored financial services.

## Features

- **Feature Engineering**: Cleansing and normalization of credit data.
- **Calculating Credit Score**: Calculating a credit score using fico formula.

$$
    credit_score = (payment_history *0.35) + (credit_utilization_ratio* 0.30) + (number_of_credit_accounts *0.15) + (education_level* 0.10) + (employment_status * 0.10)
$$

- **Segmentation based on credit score**: Identification and selection of relevant credit attributes.
- ***Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for credit scoring.
- ***Segmentation**: Clustering of customers into segments based on credit score ranges.
- ***Evaluation**: Metrics and methods to assess the performance of the credit scoring model.

## Installation
